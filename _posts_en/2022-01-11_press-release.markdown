Experts from the fields of medicine and life sciences, software development and visual communication, statistics and research methods are now providing an extensive and constantly growing collection of current scientific documents and studies on the viral disease COVID-19 on their new website _Corona Studies_ – [coronastudies.org](https://coronastudies.org).

The focus of the website is on studies related to prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease, effects and side effects of novel vaccines, aspects of immunity, and effects of non-medical interventions to contain COVID-19.

“We are experiencing a debate around a Corona narrative that is being conducted with great rigor,” the members of the interdisciplinary Swiss-German project team agree. The documentation of broad knowledge on the basis of academic studies appear to be the only way to initiate a constructive debate around the subject. Providing people with comprehensive information that can be easily and quickly understood by experts and lay people alike is a matter close to the heart of _Corona Studies_. In doing so, it is especially important to make scientific findings accessible to a broad audience that have received little attention so far. As a system of knowledge and documentation, _Corona Studies_ can also be used in processes of scientific reappraisal.

The project team aims to ensure that the public discourse becomes again evidence-based and human and loses its toxicity. The tense social situation is also the reason why the group wishes to remain anonymous for the time being, in order to protect itself from defamation and discredit.

Medical doctors, scientists, as well as interested laypersons can find a compilation of scientific documents and empirical studies in German and English on the website. Documents are categorized into five chronologically ordered topics: “virus,” “immunity,” “prevention and treatment,” “vaccines,” and “non-medical interventions.” The English-language content is automatically translated into German using DeepL, and the original studies are linked. The new website will continue to grow in the coming months, will be kept up to date and will be translated into several languages.

In addition to the studies provided, the team is preparing scientific findings thematically in an online journal. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coronastudies) and other social media are used for dissemination.

The team is happy to receive suggestions and questions, but also to receive reinforcement in the areas of EDP and translation. Contact: [info@coronastudies.org](mailto:info@coronastudies.org).
