On their new website _Corona Studies_ – [coronastudies.org](https://coronastudies.org) - experts from the fields of medicine and life sciences, software development and visual communication, statistics and research methods provide an extensive and constantly growing collection of current scientific documents and studies on the viral disease COVID-19. 

The focus of Corona Studies is on the presentation of studies related to prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease, effects and side effects of novel vaccines, aspects of immunity, and the effects of non-medical interventions employed to contain COVID-19.

“We are experiencing a debate about the interpretive sovereignty surrounding Corona that is being conducted with great rigor,” the interdisciplinary project team of German-Swiss volunteers, agree. The development and presentation of wide-ranging and broad knowledge based on scientifically sound findings from studies and working papers appear to the group to be the only way to conduct a constructive debate on the subject. Providing all people with comprehensive information that can be understood by experts and lay people alike, and providing information quickly and easily, is a matter close to the heart of _Corona Studies_. In doing so, it is especially important to bring little-noticed scientific findings to light and to make them accessible to a broad audience. As a source of knowledge and documentation, _Corona Studies_ can also be used in processes of scientific reappraisal.

Last but not least, the project team would like to help ensure that public discourse is once again factual, evidence-based and humane - in short, that it loses its toxicity. The tense social situation is also the reason why for the time being, the group wishes to remain anonymous, in order to protect itself from defamation and discredit.

Practicing physicians and scientists, as well as interested lay people can find a compilation of scientific documents and published empirical studies in German and English on the _Corona Studies_ website. The studies and documents are categorized into five chronologically ordered topics: “virus,” “immunity,” “prevention and treatment,” “vaccines,” and “non-medical measures.” 

The English-language content is automatically translated into German using [DeepL](https://deepl.com), and the original studies are linked directly. In the coming months the new website will continue to grow, will be kept up to date and will be translated into several languages. In addition to the studies provided, the team is preparing scientific findings thematically in an online journal. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coronastudies) and other social media are used for dissemination.

The team is happy to receive suggestions and questions, as well as to receive reinforcement in the areas of <abbr title="electronic data processing">EDP</abbr> and translation. Contact: [info@coronastudies.org](mailto:info@coronastudies.org).
